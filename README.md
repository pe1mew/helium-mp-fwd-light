# Multi packet forwarder and Helium gateway-rs in Balena
This repository represents my work on merging the Multi-protocol-packet-forwarder of Jac Kersing 
from https://github.com/kersing/ttn-resin-gateway-rpi-1 that was forked of JP Meijers implementation
of Multi-protocol-packet-forwarder in Balena https://github.com/jpmeijers/ttn-resin-gateway-rpi together
with the work of Marc Pous https://github.com/mpous/helium-data-hotspot of Balena.

The purpose of my work is to combine Helium Gateway-light with Multi-protocol-packet-forwarder in Balena
on a single LoRaWAN gateway; The best of both worlds. The setup will add Helium connectivity to the 
Multi-protocol-packet-forwarder.

This repository was hacked together during the Balena Hackaton that was held on October 17th, 2021.
